# story-language syntax extension

This is a simple vscode extension to gain simple syntax-highlighting for the "story-language" developed in the sopra.
It was created quick and dirty and will (at least probably) not be updated in the near future.

The language is embeded into the [game-server](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/game-server)-repository.
